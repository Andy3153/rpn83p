# Changelog

- Unreleased
- 0.3.1 (2023-08-13)
    - Add animated GIF to illustrate Examples 1 and 2 in README.md.
    - No code change.
- 0.3 (2023-08-13)
    - Move `CLRG` from F1 position to F3. Move `CLX` to F1. If the F1
      is accidentally hit twice when selecting the `CLR` menu group, then
      invoking `CLX` is a lot less destructive than invoking `CLRG`.
    - Move `IP,FP,...` menu strips before the `ABS,SIGN,...` menu strip. The
      `IP,FP` functions seem more frequently used than the `ABS,SIGN` functions.
- 0.2.1 (2023-08-13)
    - Update README.md. Test minor version number with new release.
    - No code change.
- 0.2 (2023-08-13)
    - Update downloading and installation instructions.
- 0.1 (2023-08-13)
    - Create a release, with the `.8xk` so that I can see what a GitHub release
      asset looks like, which allows me to write a better Installation guide.
- 0.0 (2023-07-14)
    - Initial extraction and upload to GitHub from my internal playground repo.
